The _config file controls a lot of the information about me.

The _posts folder contains all of the posts, which are used to build the site.
To write a post, do it in a notebook, then save it as markdown.
And name it properly using the date.
Example: 2018-02-13-this-is-the-title.md

The assets folder contains images.
